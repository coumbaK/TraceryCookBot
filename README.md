## Describe your bot's character

I made an italian bot that can only cook Authentic pasta and hates Mac and Cheese. He will also talk to you and ask about your day.

## How does the user know what to say to this bot How are you solving the blank slate problem?

My questions are very specific or close-ended.

## How have your styled your page to best present this character? What scene or mood are you suggesting?

I'm representing a scene where the user is welcomed home by the home who offers to cook dinner so I chose a background picture of italian streets and town houses to give that familiar vibe.

## Describe the first thing this bot can respond to.  What is the expressive range of what you say in response?

First ,the bot asks the user what he wants to eat and if the response is pasta then he suggests a specific pasta dish , if the response is mac and cheese then the bot becomes upset and finally if the users replies with any other food the bot will let him know he can only cook one thing : pasta.


## Describe the second thing this bot can respond to

the bot will suggest a pasta recipe and the user can ask for something else and ask him to cook that.


## Describe the third thing this bot can respond to

the bot will ask the user for a song choice and tell him he can't find it on Sbotify before playing a song of his choice.
