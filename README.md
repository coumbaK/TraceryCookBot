## Describe your bot's character

I made an italian bot that can only cook Authentic pasta and hates Mac and Cheese. He will also talk to you and ask about your day.

## How does the user know what to say to this bot How are you solving the blank slate problem?

My questions are very specific or close-ended.

## How have your styled your page to best present this character? What scene or mood are you suggesting?

I'm representing a scene where the user is welcomed home by the bot who offers to cook dinner so I chose a background picture of italian streets and town houses to give that familiar vibe.

## Describe the first thing this bot can respond to.  What is the expressive range of what you say in response?

First ,the bot asks the user what he wants to eat and if the response is pasta then the bot suggests a specific pasta dish , if the response is mac and cheese then it becomes upset and finally if the users replies with any other food the bot will let him know he can only cook one thing : pasta.


## Describe the second thing this bot can respond to

the bot will suggest a pasta recipe and the user can ask for something else and ask the bot to cook that.


## Describe the third thing this bot can respond to

the bot will ask the user for a song choice and tell him it's not on Sbotify before playing a song of its choice.


## Describe the fourth thing this bot can respond to

the bot can ask the user about his day or week and respond to that with supportive words.


## Describe the fifth thing this bot can respond to

the bot can ask the user what he thinks about the food and respond to that with a positive or negative reaction.



## What states does this bot move through? Is this a common social script? Why do the states connect like that?

My bot follows a common social script,it starts by asking the user what he would like to eat and makes conversation while cooking and listening to music before serving the food and asking for the user's review. I tried to make these states connect in a natural way like a conversation with a human friend.



## In what ways does your bot obey or subvert the Gricean maxims

my bot follows the maxim of quantity when it comes to describing the pasta it is making and giving a lot of information to convince the user.It also follows teh maxims of relation and manner with clear sentences that are concise and easily understandable in the context of the conversation.
